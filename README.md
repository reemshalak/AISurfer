<h1 align="center">AI Surfer 2018🌊🤖</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A Unity-based AI simulation University project where a digital surfer learns to jump and avoid obstacles autonomously.</strong><br>
  Inspired by the Google Chrome dinosaur game, this project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Algorithms to help the AI improve itself over time.
</p>


## 🌟 Features
- **Self-Learning AI**: The surfer starts with basic knowledge and gradually learns through trial and error.
- **Genetic Evolution**: The best-performing "surfers" combine their traits to create better ones in the next generation.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Procedurally generated obstacles and waves provide endless challenges.
- **Real-Time Learning**: Watch as the AI learns, adapts, and improves over time.
- **Unity-Powered Gameplay**: Smooth and visually engaging surfing mechanics designed using Unity.

## 🌊 How It Works
1. The AI begins with a simple neural network and basic behaviors.
2. When the surfer "wipes out," the AI uses that feedback to adjust its decision-making.
3. Over multiple generations, the AI evolves by combining the traits of the most successful surfers using a **Genetic Algorithm**.
4. The result: An AI that becomes smarter, faster, and better at overcoming obstacles without human input.
